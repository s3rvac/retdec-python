.. title:: Quickstart

Quickstart
==========

This page gives an overview of the library and tools to get you started.

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 3.2 or PyPy3 >= 2.4
* `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org>`_ module for making HTTPS calls to the `retdec.com API <https://retdec.com/api/>`_

Installation
------------

The recommended way of installing is from `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org>`_ (PyPI) with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install retdec-python

This will install the latest stable version, including all dependencies. You can also install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/s3rvac/retdec-python

Prerequisites
-------------

To be able to actually use the library and scripts, you need to `register <https://retdec.com/registration/>`_ at `retdec.com <https://retdec.com>`_. After that, `log in <https://retdec.com/login/>`_ and click on `Account <https://retdec.com/account/>`_. There, you will find your API key, which is used for authentication.

.. attention::

    Be careful not to disclose your API key to anyone! `You have to keep it a secret  <https://retdec.com/api/docs/essential_information.html#authentication>`_.

Library vs Scripts
------------------

`retdec-python <https://github.com/s3rvac/retdec-python>`_ provides both a Python library and scripts. You can either incorporate the library in your own scripts:

.. code-block:: python

    from retdec.decompiler import Decompiler

    decompiler = Decompiler(api_key='YOUR-API-KEY')
    decompilation = decompiler.start_decompilation(input_file='file.exe')
    decompilation.wait_until_finished()
    decompilation.save_hll_code()

or you can use the provided scripts for stand-alone file analyses or decompilations:

.. code-block:: text

    $ decompiler -k YOUR-API-KEY file.exe
    v23bmYb67R
    ----------

    Waiting for resources (0%)...                      [OK]
    Pre-Processing:
        Obtaining file information (5%)...             [OK]
        Unpacking (10%)...                             [OK]
    Front-End:
        Initializing (20%)...                          [OK]
    [..]
    Done (100%)...

    Downloading:
     - file.c

Either way, ``file.c`` then contains the decompiled C code:

.. code-block:: text

    $ cat file.c
    //
    // This file was generated by the Retargetable Decompiler
    // Website: https://retdec.com
    // Copyright (c) 2016 Retargetable Decompiler <info@retdec.com>
    //

    #include <stdio.h>
    [..]

The library currently provides basic support of the `decompilation <https://retdec.com/api/docs/decompiler.html>`_, `fileinfo <https://retdec.com/api/docs/fileinfo.html>`_, and `test <https://retdec.com/api/docs/test.html>`_ services.

Next, we describe the library in a greater detail. If you wish to learn more about the provided scripts instead, continue :doc:`here <scripts>`.
